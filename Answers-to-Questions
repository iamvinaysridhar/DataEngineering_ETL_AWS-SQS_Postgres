Configuration
SQS Queue URL: http://localhost:4566/000000000000/login-queue

Postgres Credentials:
Database: postgres
User: postgres
Password: postgres
Host: localhost
Port: 5432

Assumptions
1. The SQS queue and Postgres database are accessible locally through Docker containers.
2. Sensitive PII fields like device_id and ip are hashed using SHA-256 to easily identify duplicates.

Future Improvements

1. Improve error handling and logging mechanisms.
2. Use environment variables instead of hard-coding configuration values.
3. Write unit and integration tests for better code coverage and quality.
4. Set up a CI/CD pipeline like Jenkins for automated builds and deployments.

Scaling

1. For handling large volumes of data, use a scalable message broker like Kafka instead of SQS.
2. Implement batch processing of messages for improved throughput.
3. Optimize database operations by indexing frequently queried columns and tables.

PII Recovery
1. Store original unhashed PII data in an encrypted form for potential recovery later.
2. If PII recovery is needed, use a reversible hashing technique like bcrypt instead of SHA-256.
